# Connect-X

Connect X is a variation of the game Connect 4.

## Iteration 1

A direct implementation of Connect 4 on the command line.

## Iteration 2

The user is able to specifiy the size of the board as well as the number of "token" in a row that are required to win.
Also implemented the orginal class with an interface.

## Iteration 3

The user is able to specify the number of players and pick the token that will represent each player.
Also included a new implementation of the class in addition to the original implementation. This new implementation also used an interface.

## Iteration 4

This iteration did not add any new features this solely was meant to write test cases for the game.

## Notes
I now have a better understanding of UML diagrams.
